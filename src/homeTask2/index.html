    <h3>History</h3>
    The Whistler Grocery Store opened in 1980 as an anchor business in the purpose built Whistler Village. In 1988 Bob
    and
    Sue Adams purchased the business from the original owners. The business grew and adapted to the growing success of
    Whistler Resort. While the resort was recognized many times and to this day as the leading Four Season resort in
    North
    America so did the Grocery Store. In 2002 the company received the designation of Canadian Independent Grocer of the
    Year, in 2001 the Adams were awarded the Whistler Chamber of Commerce Business Person's of the Year. In 2009 they
    were
    awarded The Whistler Business and the Arts Award for their contribution and leadership supporting cultural
    development
    in the community. Each year the Store receives an Award of Merit from the Canadian Federation of Independent
    Grocers;
    this award is given to industry members who satisfy a rigorous on-site evaluation of all aspects of the operation.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How does the quality of the food that I order from WeGoShop.com compare to what I can find at my local grocery
        store?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will find the quality of the products the exact same as your local grocery store because that is where
            we get your groceries, from the local grocery store of your choice!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Can I trust WeGoShop.com to pick my meat, produce and other fresh foods?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Absolutely! Our shoppers will shop for your meats, produce and other fresh foods just as if they were
            shopping for themselves, including checking for the latest expiration date. If we don't feel that it's good
            enough for us, why would it be good enough for you? We pride ourselves on customer satisfaction and we
            believe that if you are not a satisfied customer then you wont be a repeat customer and repeat customers are
            the livelihood of our business.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Do you shop at "Warehouse" Type Stores like Costco or Sam's Club?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Yes, provided that this is a local store. We do ask however, that you please be familiar with the items that
            these stores carry. Normally these types of stores are for bulk purchases and they do not carry particular
            brands or sizes that you would usually be able to purchase at your neighborhood grocery store. Please
            understand that some of these stores require a membership, therefore it is at the discretion of each
            independently owned and operated WeGoShop.com location whether or not there will be an additional fee for
            shopping at these types of stores for your order.
